import sys

# This reads all of stdin and converts it into a list of integers.
# This *only* works if there are no non-integers in the input.
# You can learn how to deal with errors later...
x = [int(a) for a in sys.argv[2:]]

# if you have a list of integers you want to write to stdout in the same
# space separated format, you cannot use print(x) since that will add the
# square brackets and the commas, but you can use
#
# print(" ".join(str(i) for i in x))
#
# to first translate the integers into strings, (str(i) for i in x),
# and then merge them with spaces between them, " ".join(...).
#
# In the exercises where you need to print lists, that is what
# we need to do, but you can use this function to make the code
# a little more readable:


def print_list(x):
    print(" ".join(str(i) for i in x))


# We haven't covered functions yet, it is a few weeks away, but all
# you have to do to print a list, `y`, is to write `print_list(y)`.

# In sys.argv we find the command-line arguments a Python program
# receives. The first, `sys.argv[0]`, is just the name of the
# program, so the first real argument is `sys.argv[1]`. We use that
# to distinguish between which of the three operations we want to
# execute. If `sys.argv[1]` is "mean", we want to use your first
# exercise, if it is "times", it is the second exercise, and if it is
# "even" it is the third. Any other option is an error.
